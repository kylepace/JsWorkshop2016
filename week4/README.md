## Week 4 Sample Exercises

## Warm up Exercises
1. Find the bug. The code for the first problem should print out a value. Figure out why it's broken and do whatever you need to fix it.
2. Using the input box labelled "stringLength", console.log anytime the length of the input string is divisible by 5. For example, type in "Hello" should log out "true". "John" should log out false.
3. Using the input box "isANumber" and the section "numberSection", show the section whenever a *number* is typed into the textbox and hide whenever it is just a plain string.

### Tabs

- Show and hide content based on the tab displayed.
- Auto switch tabs after 2 seconds.

### To-Do List
1. Add a text box and button to the page. Console.log out any time a user pushes the button.
2. Verify that there is text in the box when pushing the button. If not, then alert() the user.
3. Add a section (maybe a "div") to the page to hold the to-dos. When the "Add to-do" button is pressed and there is text in the textbox, then replace the contents with the contents of the to-do input. Make sure to clear out the textbox to make it easier to add more items.
4. Now, instead of just adding to the html, store a collection of to-dos variables for later use.
5. Display all of the to-dos in the HTML as they are created. Make sure they all show, not just the last one entered.
6. Add the ability to delete a to-do from the list. Add a link or button next to each to-do in the list. On click of the button, remove the to-do next to the remove button. Hint: look up array splice!
7. Now that add and remove are done, add another textbox next to the original to-do box to represent "priority". This will be a number to show how important the task is in relation to the other tasks.
8. After pressing the "Add" button, also include the priority when adding the to-do to the collection.
9. Display the priority next to the to-do in the list.
10. Add two buttons to sort the list by priority ascending or descending.
11. On click of each of those buttons, re-display the list in the correct order.
